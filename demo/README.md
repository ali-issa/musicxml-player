MusicXML Player Demo
====================

This is a demo for the MusicXML Player reusable component, showcasing MusicXML rendering, MIDI conversion, Web Audio and Web MIDI playback. It is a functional clone of the [earlier demo](https://github.com/infojunkie/ireal-musicxml/tree/main/demo/web) where the above functionality was hard-coded into the HTML app. By contrast, in this demo, the playback and rendering functionalities are all encapsulated in the `musicxml-player` module, with only the demo UI coded in `demo.mjs`.

- Install and run [`musicxml-mma` API endpoint separately](https://github.com/infojunkie/musicxml-mma#installation)
